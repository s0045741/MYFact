# Ionic Framework SQLite Example - One Word Save
An example Ionic framework that use ngCordova's SQLite plugin. 

According to my training session. I decided to provide a quick, clean example, to show how to save/load data from SQLite database in mobile application which built on Ionic framework technology. 

> I used Ionic CLI version 1.3.19.

## Installation 

After clone the project, you need to add your platform and ngCordova's SQLite plugin:
```
ionic state restore
cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage.git
ionic platform add android
ionic platform add ios
```
Then go on.

## Important Note

ngCordova's SQLite plugin doesn't work on Web browser. You've to run the project in Simulator or real device.
